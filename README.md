# Daily Tarot Card Draw
This is a dataset of random numbers generated for daily tarot card draws, originally designed for an applet on [Tidbyt](https://github.com/tidbyt/community).

Each number represents an index of potential cards for every tarot card (i.e., 0-77) or just cards from the Major arcana (i.e., 0-21).

Numbers are generate using [RANDOM.ORG](https://www.random.org/) and pushed daily via [Make](https://www.make.com/) every midnight `America/New_York` time.
